# Reverse engineering proxy for the network protocol of Anno 1602

This proxy application is used to capture, optionally modify and then forward network packets sent between instances of Anno 1602 in a network game.

The protocol being reverse engineered will be dubbed x642 (hex for 1602 as in Anno 1602).
