I want to build an environment where 1-4 game instances can be running with their network traffic being intercepted by my own custom proxy and analyzed by my custom tooling.\n\n\nI have the following technologies in mind recently:\n\n\nOne docker container, that runs the games and a custom networking application.\nEach instance runs in its isolated Linux netns and has a VNC server running, in which the game is run via wine.\n\nThe networking application has a link to each netns via veth devices to map traffic and hosts a web interface, to which I can connect from my host system to view the game windows and the network traffic along with the results of my custom parsing solutions. Alternatively the application doing the analysis can be separate and running just on the host with hot reloading capabilities.\n\nCRIU could be used to to take snapshots of the games to\nprovide fast startup times from the second run onwards\n\nfreeze and restore the game state without loss of information whenever the debugging application gets reloaded after code changes\nthis could benefit from having each game instance handle TCP/UDP connections and transform them to events that can be handled via pub/sub and stored, such that current game state does not break after hot reloading"

Let's assume the game may run continuously, we need to have one service connected to each game instance persistently, such that the network connection stays uninterrupted, this service will not need to hot reload during a game session since it's sole purpose is to handle the network connection with a single game session and forward events to our event infrastructure.\n\n\nWe can then make sure this service can buffer and replay events after a hot reload."

      "role": "Prompt",
      "say": "Let's change our components as following, unless you have a good reason against it:\n\n\n2-4 network service instances, let's name them game adapters, each handing one game connection. Theoretically we could accept connections from games running on other's computers, our remaining infrastructure only cares about our own networking service at this point. The service translates packets into raw data and connection info and sends them to our central orchestrator. Can only reload when we start a new multiplayer game. Will accept a connection from the orchestrator, and upon connecting, the orchestrator will provide it's last sequence number from that game adapter such that events missed can be replayed. The game adapter keeps a buffer of events received from the game to replay and game adapter sequence numbers only concern packets received from the game that that adapter handles. Once an event was ACKed, it is removed from the buffer. Also assigns timestamps to packets received from the game.\n\norchestrator, routes traffic between the game adapters, can mutate packets if needed and will assigns session sequence numbers to packets received from the game adapters. Will establish it's connection to adapters and insert new events into our persistence layer as well as broadcast them to tools like the web interface. For now the packet analysis can be inside the same code for the orchestrator, since we can hot reload it. But we can split that out eventually. For the traffic routing we consider if packets need to be modified.\n\n\nLet's not jump into any code examples for now, since we're still planning, although I appreciate them.\n\n\nWould you say one game adapter per game instance or one game adapter handling connections would be better? We are talking about the game adapter managing a single multiplayer session, including all host and 1-3 clients, or one adapter per game instance of Anno 1602 and then each connecting to the orchestrator.\n\n\nAlso, after this, let's summarize the current WIP of the architecture."

      "say": "Great refinement! This creates a much cleaner separation of concerns. Let me address your key question first, then summarize the architecture.\n\n\nGame Adapter Strategy: One per Game Instance\n\n\nI'd recommend one game adapter per game instance (so 2-4 adapters total for a multiplayer session) rather than one adapter handling the entire session. Here's why:\n\n\nBenefits of One Adapter Per Game Instance:\n\n\nIsolation: Each adapter only needs to understand its own game's network behavior\n\nScalability: Easy to add/remove players without affecting other adapters\n\nDebugging: Clear attribution of network issues to specific game instances\n\nFailure isolation: One game crashing doesn't affect other adapters\n\nLoad distribution: Natural load balancing across adapters\n\nRemote play ready: Already architected for games on different machines\n\n\nOrchestrator's Role Becomes Clearer:\n\n\nReceives events from multiple adapters (game1, game2, game3, game4)\n\nCorrelates packets across the multiplayer session\n\nHandles session-wide sequence numbering\n\nRoutes packets between game instances when needed\n\nManages the \"multiplayer session\" as a concept\n\n\nExample Flow:\n\n\nGame1 → Adapter1 → Orchestrator ← Adapter2 ← Game2\nGame3 → Adapter3 → Orchestrator ← Adapter4 ← Game4\n         ↓\n    Persistence + Analysis + Web UI\n\n\nThe orchestrator sees events like:\n\n\nadapter1_seq_142: player1 sends trade request\n\nadapter2_seq_89: player2 receives trade request\n\nadapter2_seq_90: player2 accepts trade\n\nadapter1_seq_143: player1 receives acceptance\n\n\nCurrent Architecture Summary\n\n\nComponents:\n\n\nGame Adapters (2-4 instances, persistent)\n\n\nPurpose: Translate game network traffic to events\n\nResponsibilities:\nAccept single game instance connection\n\nAssign timestamps to received packets\n\nMaintain adapter-specific sequence numbers\n\nBuffer events for replay (until ACKed by orchestrator)\n\nHandle reconnection with orchestrator\n\nReplay missed events based on orchestrator's last sequence\n\nReload policy: Only during new multiplayer session startup\n\nState: Maintains event buffer and adapter sequence counter\n\n\nOrchestrator (1 instance, hot reloadable)\n\n\nPurpose: Central coordination and session management\n\nResponsibilities:\nConnect to all game adapters\n\nAssign session-wide sequence numbers\n\nRoute/mutate packets between game instances as needed\n\nInsert events into persistence layer\n\nBroadcast events to analysis tools and web UI\n\nTrack last processed sequence per adapter for replay\n\nHandle packet analysis (for now, can be split later)\n\nReload policy: Hot reloadable during active sessions\n\nState: Session sequence counter, per-adapter last sequence tracking\n\n\nPersistence Layer\n\n\nPurpose: Event storage and querying\n\nTechnology: SQLite (as discussed) with event schema\n\nManaged by: Orchestrator\n\n\nWeb Interface (hot reloadable)\n\n\nPurpose: Real-time visualization and analysis\n\nReceives: Events from orchestrator via WebSocket/pub-sub\n\n\nData Flow:\n\n\nGame → Adapter: Raw network packets\n\nAdapter → Orchestrator: Timestamped events with adapter sequence IDs\n\nOrchestrator → Persistence: Events with session sequence IDs\n\nOrchestrator → Web UI: Real-time event broadcast\n\nOrchestrator → Adapter: ACK messages to clear buffers\n\n\nSequence Number Strategy:\n\n\nAdapter sequences: Per-adapter, only for packets from that game instance\n\nSession sequences: Global, assigned by orchestrator for the entire multiplayer session\n\nReplay mechanism: Orchestrator tells adapter \"I have up to adapter_seq_X from you\" on reconnection\n\n\nHot Reload Capabilities:\n\n\nGame Adapters: No hot reload during active session (persistent network connections)\n\nOrchestrator: Full hot reload with adapter reconnection and event replay\n\nWeb Interface: Full hot reload with state resync from orchestrator\n\nAnalysis modules: Hot reload within orchestrator (or split out later)\n\n\nThis architecture gives you the reliability of persistent game connections while maintaining maximum flexibility for iterating on your analysis and coordination logic. The orchestrator becomes the \"smart\" component that understands the multiplayer session, while adapters stay simple and focused on their individual games.\n\n\nDoes this align with your vision? Any adjustments to the component responsibilities or data flow?"
