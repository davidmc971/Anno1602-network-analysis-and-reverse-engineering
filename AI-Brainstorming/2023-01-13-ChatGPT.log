Q: I am currently reverse engineering the netcode of an old game, Anno 1602. I am writing my custom proxy software in TypeScript using Node.js and am trying to use streams to efficiently intercept, read, modify and pass network packets sent between the different players in a network session. I do this to ultimately write my own AI that can join a lobby and play against humans. Would you be able to give me any tips on the structure of my proxy software?
A: Here are a few tips for structuring your proxy software:

  - Use a duplex stream for each connection. This allows you to read and write data from the same stream, which is useful for intercepting and modifying packets.

  - Use a pipeline of streams to process the data. For example, you could use a stream to decompress the data, another stream to parse it into a structured format, and another stream to apply your modifications.

  - Use the Transform stream class to implement your packet modifications. This class allows you to define a transform method that is called for each chunk of data, making it easy to make changes to the packet.

  - Use the pipe method to connect the streams together. This allows you to chain your processing streams together in a readable way.

  - Make sure to handle errors and close events properly. If a connection is closed, you should close the corresponding streams, so that any remaining data is flushed and resources are freed.

  - Consider using a library like pcap or pcapjs to capture network packets and send them to your proxy.

  - Lastly, you could use a library such as Socket.io or WebSockets to handle the communication between your AI and the game, which will make it easier to communicate with the game and other players.

It is important to note that reversing engineering is often against the terms of service of a software, so you should check the license agreement of the game before proceeding.

Q: That's great! Do you know about DirectPlay and UDP Proxying?
A: Yes, I'm familiar with both DirectPlay and UDP proxying.

DirectPlay is a deprecated library developed by Microsoft for creating online multiplayer games. It provides a set of APIs for network communication, including support for peer-to-peer and client-server networking, and supports both TCP and UDP.

UDP proxying is the process of intercepting and forwarding UDP packets between clients. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as load balancing, traffic shaping, or security.

When implementing a proxy for a game that uses DirectPlay and UDP, you would need to intercept and forward the UDP packets being sent between the clients. You can do this by binding to the same port as the game and forwarding the packets to the appropriate destination.

In addition, you'll need to handle the DirectPlay communication, which typically includes messages such as session creation, player joining/leaving, game state updates, etc. You can do this by creating your own implementation of the DirectPlay APIs, or by using a library that provides a DirectPlay compatibility layer.

It is important to note that some games use encryption for their netcode, which would make it more difficult to intercept, read, and modify the packets, so you would need to find a way to decrypt them first, if this is the case.

Also, as mentioned before, it is important to check the license agreement of the game, as reverse engineering may be prohibited by the terms of service.

Q: I am using blackbox reverse engineering and I am aiming at LAN-Sessions, no worries about the terms of service.
A: Great, if you're using blackbox reverse engineering and your goal is to use your proxy for LAN sessions, then you should be able to proceed with your project without any issues related to the terms of service.

To implement your proxy, you'll need to capture the UDP packets being sent between the clients, and forward them to the appropriate destination. You can do this by binding to the same port as the game and forwarding the packets to the appropriate destination.

When it comes to handling the DirectPlay communication, you could inspect the packets and try to identify the message types based on the packet structure and contents, and then implement your own logic for handling those messages.

It's also important to consider the performance of your proxy software and make sure that it does not introduce a bottleneck or significant latency in the communication.

Finally, if your game uses encryption, you would need to find a way to decrypt the packets before you can inspect and modify them.

Overall, it's a challenging task, but with a good understanding of the game's network communication and a solid understanding of network programming, you should be able to implement a functional proxy for your game.

Q: Perfect. Network code is not encrypted, but do you have any tips on interpreting the raw data e.g. about buying a ship or moving an entity?
A: Interpreting raw data from a network packet can be a challenging task, but here are a few tips that may help:

  - Start by analyzing the packet structure. Try to identify any patterns or repeated structures in the packet data. Look for headers, footers, or other markers that indicate the start and end of different parts of the packet.

  - Look for known values. If you know the expected value of a particular field in the packet, such as a message type, look for that value in the packet data. This can help you identify the purpose of different parts of the packet.

  - Inspect the packet contents in a hex editor. This can give you a better understanding of the actual bytes that make up the packet, and can help you identify patterns or known values.

  - Look for documentation or resources online. If the game has been reverse-engineered before, there may be documentation or resources available that describe the packet structure and contents.

  - Try to understand the context of the packet. For example, if you're looking at a packet that's sent when a player buys a ship, try to understand the process of buying a ship in the game, and what information would be necessary to send in the packet.

  - Experiment with the game. Try different actions in the game, and observe the packets that are sent and received. This can give you a better understanding of how the game uses the network, and can help you identify the purpose of different packets.

  - You could try to use packet sniffers like Wireshark, to inspect the packets and see if you can see a clear structure and meaning in the data.

It is important to note that interpreting the raw data from a network packet can be a difficult task, as it may require a deep understanding of the game's mechanics and the inner workings of the network protocol. But by following these tips, you should be able to make progress in understanding the packets and their contents.

Q: This is great, but I am facing another problem: When I make changes to the interpreting / parsing of packets my proxy has to be restarted in order to test those changes. However this leads to closing of any active sockets which can end a network session in game. Can I use HMR to reload part of a Node.js application (only the parsing, not the connections)?
A: Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is a feature that allows you to reload parts of a Node.js application without needing to restart the entire process. This can be useful in situations like the one you described, where you need to test changes to your packet parsing code without disrupting active network connections.

Here are a few ways you could use HMR to reload your packet parsing code without restarting the entire proxy:

  - Use a HMR library such as node-hot. This library allows you to reload specific modules in your application without needing to restart the entire process. You can use it to reload just the packet parsing module, without affecting the rest of the proxy.

  - Use a development tool such as nodemon, which can monitor your code for changes and automatically restart the process. You can configure it to ignore the packet parsing module, so that it does not get restarted when you make changes to it.

  - Use a tool like dynamic-import-node which allows you to use the import() syntax to load modules dynamically. This way you can reload the packet parsing module without affecting the rest of the proxy.

  - Implement your own HMR mechanism, which could involve setting up a separate process that would handle the packet parsing and that could be easily restarted without affecting the main process.

Keep in mind that using HMR requires you to design your code in a way that allows for easy reloading, so it may require some restructuring of your codebase.

It is important to note that, any of these solutions may require some additional work to integrate with your existing codebase, but they should be able to help you achieve your goal of being able to test your changes without disrupting active network connections.

Q: Awesome! Another question I have is whether I can host multiple instances of the game in network-isolated containers and only allow them to bind to the proxy for communication.
A: Yes, you can use containers to host multiple instances of the game and isolate them from each other. This can be useful for testing your proxy software with multiple players and different game scenarios.

To set this up, you would need to use a containerization platform such as Docker, and create a container for each game instance. Each container would need to have the game installed and configured to use the proxy for network communication.

You can use Network Namespaces to create a virtual network stack, and then use iptables or similar tools to forward the traffic from the game instances to the proxy. This way you can isolate the game instances from each other, and ensure that they only communicate through the proxy.

Another way to achieve this is by using container orchestration tools like Kubernetes or Mesos, you can use their built-in network isolation features to create a virtual network, where each pod or container is only able to communicate with the proxy service or other pods and containers.

It is important to note that this would require a good understanding of containerization and network configuration, as well as the specifics of your game and the proxy software. But with the right knowledge, you should be able to set up a network-isolated container environment for running multiple instances of the game.

Additionally, depending on the game and network configuration, you might have to adjust the firewall rules to allow the traffic from the containers to reach the proxy.

Q: Could I still see the game's graphical interface this way?
A: Yes, you should be able to see the game's graphical interface when running it in a container, as long as you properly configure the container to access the host's display.

One way to achieve this is by using a virtual network computing (VNC) server, which allows you to remotely access the game's graphical interface. You can run a VNC server inside the container and then connect to it from the host to view the game's interface.

Another way is by using a display server protocol like X11 or Wayland. You can configure the container to use the host's X11 or Wayland server by mounting the appropriate socket in the container and setting the appropriate environment variables.

Additionally, you could use tools like Xpra, which allows you to forward X11 sessions over the network and access the game's graphical interface remotely.

It is important to note that these solutions may not work for all games or configurations, and that the performance might not be the same as running the game directly on the host. You may also need to make some adjustments to the game's configuration and settings in order to get it working correctly inside a container.

Overall, with the right configuration, you should be able to see the game's graphical interface when running it in a containerized environment, however, some tweaking might be needed.

Q: I tried linux network namespaces before and I had the issue that the game instance hosting the lobby could not bind to its veth interface.
A: Yes, binding to a virtual ethernet (veth) interface can be a bit tricky when using Linux network namespaces. The game instance running in a container may not be able to bind to the veth interface because it does not have the necessary permissions or network configuration.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve the issue:

  - Make sure that the game instance has the necessary permissions to bind to the veth interface. You can use the ip command to change the interface's owner and group to the user that runs the game.
Copy code
ip link set veth0 netns game-instance-ns
ip link set veth0 owner game-user
  - Check the network configuration of the container's namespace. Make sure that the veth interface is assigned an IP address and that the default route is set correctly. You can use the ip netns exec command to run commands inside the container's namespace.
Copy code
ip netns exec game-instance-ns ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev veth0
ip netns exec game-instance-ns ip link set veth0 up
ip netns exec game-instance-ns ip route add default via 192.168.1.1 dev veth0
  - Verify that the firewall rules are configured correctly. Make sure that the game instance is allowed to bind to the veth interface, and that traffic is allowed to flow between the veth interface and the host. You can use iptables to configure the firewall rules.
Copy codestomApps

iptables -I FORWARD -i veth0 -j ACCEPT
iptables -I FORWARD -o veth0 -j ACCEPT
  - You could also check if the game is listening on the correct IP address, if the game is only listening on localhost, you would need to configure it to listen on the IP address assigned to the veth interface.
It's worth noting that some games have their own network stack and might not use the standard socket API, in this case, the game might not be able to bind to the veth interface even if it has the necessary permissions and network configuration.

It is important to note that these solutions may not work for all games or configurations, and that it could take some trial and error to find the right solution for your specific setup.
