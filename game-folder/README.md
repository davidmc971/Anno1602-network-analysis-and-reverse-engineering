# Game Folder

the scripts are WIP and not done

for some reason a custom install does not yield a running install, the application crashes right away,
however when using PlayOnLinux the install works even without further configuration, therefore
I suggest installing though PlayOnLinux and copying the wineprefic to client_install and host_install directories for now

Note: The GOG version of the game will be the main focus in the future as it is the easiest to obtain and set up
